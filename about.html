                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Heavens Love Global was born from a Spirit-inspired calling in late 2020, when Reverend Yiannis Markus felt led to plant a church on the IIEMSA campus in South Africa. What began as a small campus fellowship quickly blossomed into a thriving Christian community, impacting students with the powerful message of Christ. Driven by the Holy Spirit, Heavens Love has since expanded beyond the campus, reaching out to underserved communities like Zandspruit and transforming countless lives.

                   <br> <br> Today, Heavens Love Global embraces a growing online presence and has extended across borders to multiple campuses, including the University of Botswana and various South African universities. With a vision that’s "too global to be local," the ministry is passionately committed to spreading hope and transformation across nations, fulfilling its divine mission to reach the world with the gospel. Join us as we carry this light forward.</p>

                <h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
               <p>We stand on the authority of the Bible, embracing <strong>sola scriptura</strong>, meaning Scripture alone is our ultimate guide. God's Word grounds us in truth and wisdom.</p>
                <p>Our beliefs are rooted in the following key truths:</p>
                <p >Our core beliefs are rooted in the Bible as our ultimate guide. We affirm the existence of one eternal God in three expressions—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Jesus Christ, 
                    fully divine and human, was born of a virgin, died, rose again, and ascended to heaven, providing salvation by grace through faith. The Holy Spirit empowers believers with gifts for the Church's 
                    growth. We look forward to the rapture, Jesus’ return, and eternal life for the saved, while recognizing the judgment of the lost. Through the Holy Spirit, we are called to serve as Christ's ambassadors in the world.</p>
   <p>Through the Holy Spirit, we are empowered for service, called to be ambassadors of Christ in every sphere of life.</p>
